- .NET 6 SDK or later
- SQL Server

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
   cd library-management-system
   ```
2. Update the database connection string in `appsettings.json`.
3. Run migrations and update the database:
   ```
   dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
   dotnet ef database update
   ```
4. Start the application:
   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/books` - Get all books
- `GET /api/books/{id}` - Get book by ID
- `POST /api/books` - Add new book
- `PUT /api/books/{id}` - Update book
- `DELETE /api/books/{id}` - Delete book



Database Setup:
1. Setup SQL Server & Database
Before running the project, make sure you have SQL Server installed. If you donâ€™t have it, you can use SQL Server Express or Azure SQL.

Open appsettings.json (or appsettings.Development.json) and add the connection string:

{
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER;Database=OfficeDB;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
    }
}
Replace YOUR_SERVER with your SQL Server instance name.

Run the following Entity Framework Core commands to create the database:


dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
2. Install Dependencies
Run this in the terminal inside your project folder:


dotnet restore
3. Run the Project
Now start the project using:


dotnet run
Or if you're using Visual Studio, just press Ctrl + F5.

4. Test the API
Once the project is running, open a browser or use Postman to test the API endpoints:

GET all employees:
GET http://localhost:5000/api/employees
GET employee by ID:
GET http://localhost:5000/api/employees/{id}
POST new employee:
POST http://localhost:5000/api/employees
Body (JSON):

{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "position": "Manager",
    "salary": 5000
}
PUT update employee:
PUT http://localhost:5000/api/employees/{id}
DELETE an employee:
DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/employees/{id}
